Proper Hybrid Cloud Deployment Means Not Repeating Old Mistakes
</p><p>
Some Businesses have enjoyed the advantages of hybrid clouds for years other are just making the jump. Before you leap to a hybrid learn about the questions you need to ask to ensure best practices and minimum growing pains.
</p><p>
Hadoop makes it possible to run applications on systems with thousands of commodity hardware nodes, and to handle thousands of terabytes of data. Its distributed file system facilitates rapid data transfer rates among nodes and allows the system to continue operating in case of a node failure. This approach lowers the risk of catastrophic system failure and unexpected data loss, even if a significant number of nodes become inoperative. Consequently, Hadoop quickly emerged as a foundation for big data processing tasks, such as scientific analytics, business and sales planning, and processing enormous volumes of sensor data, including from internet of things sensors.
</p><p>
Hadoop was created by computer scientists Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2006 to support distribution for the Nutch search engine. It was inspired by Google's MapReduce, a software framework in which an application is broken down into numerous small parts. Any of these parts, which are also called fragments or blocks, can be run on any node in the cluster. After years of development within the open source community, Hadoop 1.0 became publically available in November 2012 as part of the Apache project sponsored by the Apache Software Foundation.

The Apache Hadoop project actively supports multiple projects intended to extend Hadoopâ€™s capabilities and make it easier to use. There are several top-level projects to create development tools as well as for managing Hadoop data flow and processing. Many commercial third-party solutions build on the technologies developed within the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
